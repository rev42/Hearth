/**
 * The portable-package engine: export a dashboard, import a dashboard, back up
 * a vault, restore a vault.
 *
 * Start here. The modules behind it split along one line — everything except
 * `assets.ts` is pure logic over a settings object, and `assets.ts` is the only
 * part that touches the vault:
 *
 * - `schema.ts`  the format: one envelope, three payload kinds, and the result
 *                and warning types an import reports through.
 * - `capture.ts` building a package. Resolves the vault's look-affecting
 *                settings onto a board so it draws the same elsewhere.
 * - `apply.ts`   reading and applying one, including the pre-v3 files.
 * - `refs.ts`    every field that points outside the package, and the strip
 *                the gallery hand-off needs.
 * - `assets.ts`  carrying pictures, and writing them back out.
 *
 * The two flows below are what the UI calls; everything else is re-exported for
 * the gallery pipeline and the tests.
