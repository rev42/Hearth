 *
 * Conventions:
 *  - Plain UI strings are string literals.
 *  - Strings that interpolate values are functions, so each locale controls
 *    word order and pluralization itself.
 *  - Only live UI "chrome" is translated here. User-editable seed data (the
 *    default dashboard title, starter card titles, default mobile-button
 *    labels) stays in `types.ts`/`templates.ts` as English defaults, since it
 *    is persisted to the vault the moment a dashboard is created.
